Definition: git status
This command is used to check the status of files in the repository. 
In the terminal, it shows which branch is being currently being worked on, and whether there are untracked changes and staged changes.
This command would also indicate which files are affected by a merge conflict. 
In JupyterLab IDE, this information is present on the Git tab, under the Changes tab. Changes are placed under "Staged", "Changed", and "Untracked".
